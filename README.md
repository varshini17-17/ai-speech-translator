🎙️ AI Multilingual Speech-to-Speech Translation System

An end-to-end AI-powered Speech-to-Speech Translation system that converts spoken input (audio, video, microphone, or YouTube URL) into translated text and synthesized speech across multiple Indian languages.

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a complete Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) → Neural Machine Translation (NMT) → Text-to-Speech (TTS) pipeline using modern deep learning models.
It supports English and Hindi speech input and translates the content into 12+ Indian languages, producing both translated text and corresponding speech output.

The system is designed with a modular backend architecture, an interactive OTT-style web interface, and robust audio preprocessing, making it suitable for real-world multilingual and multimedia applications.

🔁 Important Note on ASR Model Usage

⚠️ The ASR model was fine-tuned locally and is not included in this repository due to size and environment constraints.

To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, the repository supports execution using a public pretrained Whisper model, while retaining compatibility with the locally trained model.

🧠 ASR Model Configuration Options
✅ Option 1: Use Public Whisper Model (Recommended)

Edit the file:

backend/services/asr/whisper_service.py


Set:

MODEL_PATH = "openai/whisper-tiny"


This option allows immediate execution without requiring any local model files.

✅ Option 2: Use Fine-Tuned Local Whisper Model (Advanced)

If access to the trained model is available:

Place the model directory at:

models/whisper_tiny_stage2/


Ensure it contains standard Hugging Face files:

config.json
model.safetensors
tokenizer_config.json
vocab.json


Keep:

MODEL_PATH = "models/whisper_tiny_stage2"


⚠️ This option is intended for local execution only.

⚠️ Known Limitations

Free cloud tiers are insufficient due to transformer model memory requirements

Long audio processing is slower on CPU-only systems

ASR accuracy depends on audio quality and accent variability

🚀 Future Enhancements

GPU-accelerated deployment

Real-time streaming transcription

Speaker diarization

Improved Hindi ASR accuracy

Scalable cloud-native deployment
